<h1 style="background-color:powderblue;">Cigarette addiction</h1>
<p 
Cigarettes are extremely addictive because of psychological, chemical, and social factors. Nicotine is the primary substance that is extremely addictive to the brain. Nicotine can quickly alter brain chemistry so that it creates an immediate feeling some describe as a “buzz”. This “buzz” is actually the nicotine making its way from your lungs, into your bloodstream, and then up to your brain. The good feeling you get from this chemical reaction in your brain is highly addictive and leaves people just wanting more. The problem with Nicotine is it is not just physically addictive but also psychologically addictive. People make smoking cigarettes as a part of their daily routine or a part of their social life. When trying to stop it could make you feel like you’re not being yourself due to not having that being a part of your life. It’s easy to stop though, right?
