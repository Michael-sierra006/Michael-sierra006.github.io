<h1 style="background-color:powderblue;">Is Smoking that bad for you?</h1>
<p style="background-color:tomato;">While cigarettes may have a bad reputation for all their health risks, they offer many benefits for mental wellbeing, social interaction, focusing and so many more that might show how cigarettes are not the big bad picture that the media has painted them as. While we are all aware of the terrible side effects of smoking, many do not know the benefits of smoking recreationally. Beyond the physical addiction that cigarettes form they also serve as a tool for stress relief which can be very addicting to many people living in this crazy world where it feels like you just canâ€™t catch a break. This different perspective may raise eyebrows but in reality cigarettes just might not be as bad as they sound.</p>
