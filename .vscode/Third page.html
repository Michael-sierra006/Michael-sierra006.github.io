<h1 style="background-color:powderblue;"> The downsides of smoking</h1>

<p> 
  Cigarettes are known for how dangerous they are all around the world,
   but people don’t seem to stop smoking them. Smoking is known to be
    the main cause of many life-threatening situations like lung disease,
     lung cancer, and Heart failure. The damage done by cigarettes are 
     usually irreversible. In the United States the mortality rate is 3
      times the mortality rate of people who never smoked. Despite that 
      it is beneficial to healing these scars left on your organs by 
      stopping smoking. People that were shown to quit smoking by the 
      time they were 35 actually had the same average lifespan as people
       who have never smoked in their life.

<p> Around 480,000 people die every year from smoking. 
  The chance for living to age 80 years old is about 70% unless you are 
  a smoker which in that case would be 35%. It is estimated that 28.3 
  million adults are currently smoking in the United States and that is 
  not including teenagers smoking them illegally. This is insane because
   not only are these people hurt from this, but secondhand smoke has 
   also caused 41,000 deaths. These chronic smokers are not only killing 
   themselves but also the people around them. Smoking has been 
   responsible for 90% of lung cancer deaths.

<p> Smoking doesn’t only kill the lungs though, smoking hurts almost 
  every organ in the body. They are a risk to your lungs, heart, 
  immune system, eyes, skin, etc. Smoking sucks tar into your lungs 
  which gets converted into the blood. Once in the blood the tar spreads
   all over the body and affects everything around. Cigarettes also can 
   affect reproductive systems. Tabacco is known to reduce fertility in 
   both women and men. So, the age-old question is do the pros of smoking
  outweigh the cons.
