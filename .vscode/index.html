<p> While cigarettes may have a bad reputation for all their health risks,
  they offer many benefits for mental wellbeing, social interaction, 
  focusing and so many more that might show how cigarettes are not the 
  big bad picture that the media has painted them as. While we are all 
  aware of the terrible side effects of smoking, many do not know the 
  benefits of smoking recreationally. Beyond the physical addiction that 
  cigarettes form they also serve as a tool for stress relief which can 
  be very addicting to many people living in this crazy world where it 
  feels like you just canâ€™t catch a break. This different perspective may
  raise eyebrows but in reality cigarettes just might not be as bad as 
  they sound.  </p>

<p> Smoking can increase focus and has been shown to improve productivity
   in many situations. Nicotine can make the brain focus better making it 
   easier for someone to focus and get work done. Cigarettes have also 
   been shown to make more mentally happy employees. This is due to 
   structured regular and more refreshing breaks. This creates a reward 
   system for the brain. It shows the brain the more you focus the more 
   dopamine is released into the body. Which are also why cigarettes can
    be so amazing due to their euphoric feeling while smoking one.

<p> Cigarettes also helps many less social people socialize better 
  acting as an icebreaker for many. Smoking a cigarette with another 
  person can break the ice and show common interests for many laying as 
  a foundation for building a friendship. This while also giving an
   activity to do for either a group only a few people. Smoking also 
   combats boredom by giving the smoker some quick and easy to do while
    also having a feeling of accomplishment due to the dopamine rushing 
    through you. While there are all these benefits there are also 
    downsides such as addiction and side effects of smoking.
