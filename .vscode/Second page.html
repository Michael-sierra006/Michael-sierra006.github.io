<h1 style="background-color:powderblue;">Cigarette addiction</h1>
<p>
  Cigarettes are extremely addictive because of psychological, chemical, 
  and social factors. Nicotine is the primary substance that is extremely
   addictive to the brain. Nicotine can quickly alter brain chemistry so 
   that it creates an immediate feeling some describe as a “buzz”. This 
   “buzz” is actually the nicotine making its way from your lungs, into 
   your bloodstream, and then up to your brain. The good feeling you get 
   from this chemical reaction in your brain is highly addictive and 
   leaves people just wanting more. The problem with Nicotine is it is 
   not just physically addictive but also psychologically addictive.

<p> People make smoking cigarettes as a part of their daily routine or 
  a part of their social life. When trying to stop it could make you 
  feel like you’re not being yourself due to not having that being a 
  part of your life. It’s easy to stop though, right? No is the short 
  answer. Many smokers created friendships over smoking in social 
  situation and as they try to stop smoking, they also must distance 
  themselves from friends. Many often can’t quit and end up going right 
  back to cigarettes. There are also major side effects of stopping 
  smoking depending how long you have been smoking.

  <p> Some side effects could include sleep issues, mood changes,
     headaches, cold sweats, and in bad cases hallucinations. Now that 
     may not seem bad if it was for a short time but withdrawal symptoms 
     usually last around 2-4 weeks until completely subsiding. Unless 
     there are people there to help these addicts try to get off smoking 
     it is incredibly harder. Many resources recommend having a support 
     system in place and create a reward system in a more productive 
     part of your life. There are also many nicotine replacements in 
     place to ween people off of nicotine while also completely stopping 
     smoking like nicotine patches or nicotine pouches.
